A simple reaction game built with react and socket.io.
Try it on https://reaction-app-2.herokuapp.com/ with your friends, to see who is faster :)

## Developer Quick Start

_Prerequisites: In order to successfully complete this quick start, you will need to have the following installed locally:_

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

_Installation directions are beyond the scope of this document.  Instead, search the [Google](http://google.com).  Installing these two packages has been written about ad-nauseum._

From a terminal (or GitBash for Windows users), run the following commands (Please note that 'npm run server-dev' and 'npm run client-dev' should be run in separate terminals):

1. `git clone https://github.com/Tobjoern/reaction-app.git`
1. `cd reaction-app`
1. `npm install`
1. `npm run client-install`
1. `npm run server-dev`
1. `npm run client-dev`

Once that finishes doing its thing, you should see something close to the following in the terminal:

```bash
> npm run client-dev
Compiled successfully!

You can now view reaction-app in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3001/
  On Your Network:  http://192.168.178.40:3001/

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use yarn build.
```

Done.
